# Contributing to NRTSearch Ingestion Plugins

We love your input! We want to make contributing to NRTSearch Ingestion Plugins as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the project's code formatting standards.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process
1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with any new plugin configurations or features.
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers.
